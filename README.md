> **📌 This is a forked / modified version**
> Based on the original [TG-SignPulse](https://github.com/akasls/TG-SignPulse) (original author [Amchii](https://github.com/amchii), BSD-3-Clause). The upstream project is archived; this fork adds one-command Docker deployment. Original copyright and license: see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## About

TG-SignPulse is an **AI Vibe Coding learning project** created to explore and practice the integration of the following technology stacks:

- Frontend/backend separation architecture (Vue 3 + FastAPI)
- Modern Python async programming patterns
- AI/LLM API integration (OpenAI-compatible interface calls)
- Task scheduling system design (APScheduler)
- Web authentication (JWT + TOTP 2FA)

This project was built as a hands-on exercise during the author's exploration of AI-assisted programming (Vibe Coding). It demonstrates how AI coding tools can be applied in a full-stack project. The codebase was primarily generated with AI assistance, serving as a showcase of AI-driven development workflows.

## Project Status

> 🚫 **This project is discontinued and will not receive further updates.**
>
> - No pre-built images or distributions of any kind are provided
> - No new Issues or Pull Requests will be accepted
> - The code is available solely for technical learning reference

## Docker Deployment (added in this fork)

This fork adds one-command Docker deployment on top of the original project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcyh6923/TG-SignPulse.git
cd TG-SignPulse
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://<server-ip>:8080`. The default username is `admin`; the randomly generated first-run password is printed in `docker compose logs -f`. You can also set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml` to define your own.

See **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** for full details (changing ports, data persistence, proxy configuration, upgrades, etc.).

## Tech Stack

Technologies used in this project, for learning reference:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vue 3, Vue Router, Pinia, Tailwind CSS 4, Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, APScheduler |
| Auth | JWT, TOTP 2FA, bcrypt |
| AI Integration | OpenAI SDK (API call examples) |
| Third-party API | Pyrogram (Telegram MTProto protocol study) |

## Learning Highlights

This project can serve as a reference for:

1. **Full-stack project structure** — Organizing a frontend/backend separated application
2. **Async Python** — Practical use of FastAPI + asyncio
3. **Task scheduling** — Integrating APScheduler in a web application
4. **AI API calls** — Wrapping and using OpenAI-compatible interfaces
5. **Authentication system** — Implementing JWT + 2FA
6. **State management** — Using Pinia with Vue 3
